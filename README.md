## 💡 The Engineering Philosophy

I am a Full-Stack Engineer with nearly **4 years of experience** building production-grade software. I describe myself as a **Polyglot Developer**—I don't subscribe to one language; I choose the best tool for the specific business architecture.

* I use **Node.js (NestJS)** when speed-to-market, I/O concurrency, and JSON-heavy workflows are the priority.
* I use **Java (Spring Boot)** when strict type safety, complex transaction management, and enterprise patterns are required.
* I use **Next.js** to deliver performant, SEO-ready user interfaces.

## 🔧 Technical Arsenal

My focus is on stability and maintainability.

| Domain | Primary Stack |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Backend Services** | **NestJS** (Node.js), **Spring Boot** (Java), TypeScript |
| **Frontend Architecture** | **Next.js** (SSR/App Router), **React**, Tailwind CSS |
| **Data Persistence** | PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis (Caching/Queues) |
| **Cloud & DevOps** | **GCP** , **AWS**, Docker, Kubernetes |
| **System Design** | Event-Driven Architecture, REST, Microservices |

**The Engineering Challenge:**
I am currently designing a B2C/C2C logistics system. My current focus is defining the **System Boundaries** and **Data Flow** to handle shipment tracking across multiple actors (Sender, Courier, Receiver).

* **Core Logic:** leveraging **Java (Spring Boot)** for the primary service layer to ensure strict ACID compliance for billing and inventory data.
* **Design Strategy:** Exploring **Event-Driven Architecture** to decouple services. Currently evaluating different message broker patterns (Pub/Sub vs. Message Queues) to handle asynchronous status updates.
* **Scalability Planning:** Defining microservices boundaries based on domain-driven design (DDD) to prepare for a containerized deployment strategy.

## ⚡ Core Competencies

* **System Design:** Experience designing DB schemas (SQL vs NoSQL) and defining API Contracts.
* **Ownership:** I handle the full lifecycle—from Requirement Gathering to Deployment and Monitoring.
* **Remote Ready:** Experienced in asynchronous communication, thorough documentation, and working with international timezones.
